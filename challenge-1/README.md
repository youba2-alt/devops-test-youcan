## Challnge-1 details

### Context
The Media layer (called cdn - even it's not a real cdn) is composed by an app that generates and serves multiple sizes on the fly.
In first request, the app fetch the original media, generates 3 sizes (sm, md, lg), and stores them in order to serve them directly from the disk in the future.     

### Problematic
It's common that linux folders have a limit of sub-folder they can hold. 
Our internal app can save files under a custom path, but we need a custom vhost that can serve those files from that custom path.

### Expected resolution
Using ansible and docker-compose, pop-up 2 containers distributed as following:

1. 1 x Openresty container (this will contain your resolution)
2. 1 x PHP container that hosts your sample.

***Resolution example*** 

A request can ask to serve a file under the following path: `/stores/XYZ20211008ABC/categorie/image.png`

we need a vhost that can reformulate this request to the following: `/stores/XY/Z2/XYZ20211008ABC/categorie/image.png`

### Hints
Nginx doesn't support lua scripting so you can manipulate the coming request as you want, here we can introduce - lua scripting - a scripting module that is added in top of nginx to allow customized scripting.
